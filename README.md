3.  **Obtain the configuration file:**

    * The notebook attempts to locate `llm_config.py`.
    * If not found, it downloads the file from the specified URL.

    ```python
    import os
    from pathlib import Path
    import requests
    import shutil

    config_shared_path = Path("./llm_config.py")
    config_dst_path = Path("llm_config.py")

    if not config_dst_path.exists():
        if config_shared_path.exists():
            try:
                os.symlink(config_shared_path, config_dst_path)
            except Exception:
                shutil.copy(config_shared_path, config_dst_path)
        else:
            r = requests.get(
                url="[https://github.com/GodreignElgin/llm-comparision/llm_config.py](https://github.com/GodreignElgin/llm-comparision/llm_config.py)"
            )
            with open("llm_config.py", "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
                f.write(r.text)
    elif not os.path.islink(config_dst_path):
        print("LLM config will be updated")
        if config_shared_path.exists():
            shutil.copy(config_shared_path, config_dst_path)
        else:
            r = requests.get(
                url="[https://github.com/GodreignElgin/llm-comparision/llm_config.py](https://github.com/GodreignElgin/llm-comparision/llm_config.py)"
            )
            with open("llm_config.py", "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
                f.write(r.text)
    ```

## üöÄ Usage

1.  **Open the Jupyter Notebook:**

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook <notebook_name>.ipynb
    ```

2.  **Follow the notebook's instructions:**

    * The notebook provides interactive widgets to select models for skipping compression or evaluation.
    * It iterates through the models, applies compression, and performs evaluation.
    * Evaluation results are saved in CSV files.

## üß† Background Theory

### Model Compression

Model compression techniques aim to reduce the size of machine learning models, making them more efficient for storage and inference. Quantization is a key compression technique used in this pipeline.

* **Quantization**:
    * It reduces the precision of the numbers used to represent a model's weights.
    * This can significantly decrease model size and increase inference speed, often with minimal impact on accuracy.
    * The pipeline implements INT8 and INT4 quantization.
    * **INT8 Quantization**: Representing weights with 8 bits.
    * **INT4 Quantization**: Representing weights with 4 bits for higher compression.

### Evaluation Metrics

The pipeline employs various metrics to evaluate the performance of the compressed LLMs.

* **ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation)**:
    * A set of metrics commonly used to evaluate text summarization and machine translation.
    * ROUGE measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and word pairs between the generated text and reference text(s).
    * For more information, refer to this resource: \[https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W04-1013]
* **BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy)**:
    * A metric for evaluating the quality of machine-translated text.
    * BLEU measures the similarity between the machine-generated translation and one or more reference translations.
    * For more information, refer to this resource: \[https://aclanthology.org/P02-1040/]
* **Inference Time (Latency)**:
    * Measures the time it takes for a model to generate a response to a given input.
    * Lower latency indicates faster inference.
* **CHRF (Character n-gram F-score)**:
    * Metric for automatic evaluation of machine translation that uses character n-gram precision and recall.
* **Entropy**:
    * In the context of text generation, entropy can measure the randomness or unpredictability of the generated text.
* **Coherence (Cosine Similarity)**:
    * Cosine similarity can be used to measure the similarity between the embeddings of the input text and the generated text, providing a measure of coherence.
